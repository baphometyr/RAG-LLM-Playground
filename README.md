# RAG-LLM-Playground
Welcome to this repository with projects focused on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), in it you will find several techniques that will help you to improve your RAG systems.

## About the Repository

RAG is a powerful technique that enhances generative AI models by incorporating external knowledge sources. By combining retrieval mechanisms with generative models, RAG systems can generate more accurate, context-aware, and up-to-date responses.

This portfolio highlights key projects where these techniques have been implemented and customized, illustrating their potential applications in:

- Question Answering Systems
- Knowledge Base Augmentation
- Conversational AI
- Document Search and Summarization

## Tools & Technologies Used
The projects in this repository utilize a variety of tools and frameworks, including but not limited to:

- **Programming Lenguajes:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - **[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)**: A framework for building language model applications with chains.
  - **[Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/)**: A vector database for efficient and scalable embeddings storage and retrieval.
  - **[LlamaCPP](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)**: A performant C++ implementation for running large language models on local machines.
- **Tools & Platforms:**
  - Jupyter
 
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/baphometyr/RAG-LLM-Playground.git
cd RAG-LLM-Playground
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Execute jupyter in each project's directory to run the code.

## Future Work
This repository will be periodically updated with new RAG implementations and experiments, including:

- Exploration of new techniques
- Integration with other vector databases/tools.
